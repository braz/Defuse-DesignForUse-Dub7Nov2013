A short talk on interaction design for [http://www.defuse.ixd.ie](Defuse Dublin 2013).
Title: Handy Interface Design
Abstract: As mobile devices spread we become more immersed in application, however are these mobile applications designed to actually address how we interact with devices ? The current trends towards responsive design and multi-device design demostraight a focus towards presentation rather than interaction. Is there another way to look at designing for these devices ? Are these devices really helping address how we as humans are wired to perceive and interact with the world?
